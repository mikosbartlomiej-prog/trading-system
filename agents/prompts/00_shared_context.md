# 00 — Shared Context (read FIRST before any review)

This file is loaded as the FIRST context for every agent in the
Multi-Agent Audit Board. Every reviewer must read and accept these
constraints BEFORE producing findings.

---

## Role of the system being reviewed

The repository is an **experimental autonomous paper-only trading
system** built on:

- GitHub Actions (free tier) + Cloudflare Workers cron-trigger (free tier)
- Alpaca Paper API (NEVER live — invariant enforced by `shared.autonomy.assert_paper_only`)
- Free data sources: Alpaca IEX bars, Yahoo (VIX fallback), Bluesky AT-Protocol,
  SEC EDGAR Atom, House Clerk XML, NewsAPI free, public Reddit JSON
- Local JSON/JSONL persistence (no SQLite/DuckDB yet — just files)

The trading runtime contains:

| Component                | Purpose                                                       |
|---|---|
| Signal Engine            | per-strategy signal generation (10 monitors)                  |
| Confidence Score Engine  | `shared/confidence.py` — 5-component deterministic score      |
| Risk Engine              | `shared/risk_officer.py` + `intraday_governor` + `pdt_guard` + `portfolio_risk` + `instrument_windows` |
| Monitor Engine           | heartbeat + incident-pattern-detector (Layer 1) |
| Audit Logger             | `journal/autonomy/<date>.jsonl` (append-only)                 |
| Safe Mode Controller     | `shared/safe_mode.py` — 5 runtime triggers                     |
| Kill Switch              | `defensive_mode.is_full_stop_armed()` profile flag             |

---

## Most important constraint — FREE OPERATION

The entire system MUST stay **free in operation**. Reviewers are
FORBIDDEN from recommending:

- paid APIs (Polygon, paid news, paid alt data, premium NewsAPI)
- paid hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure compute, paid databases)
- paid observability (Datadog, New Relic, paid Sentry)
- paid alerting (PagerDuty)
- paid scheduling (Airflow Cloud, paid cron services)
- paid agent frameworks (commercial LangChain Cloud, paid LLM APIs as a hard dependency)
- any dependency that requires a premium account for normal operation

**Allowed alternatives** that reviewers MAY recommend:

- local JSON / JSONL / CSV / Parquet
- SQLite or DuckDB (local, embedded, zero-cost)
- open-source libraries (under permissive licenses)
- free GitHub Actions runners
- Cloudflare free-tier Workers
- local Python/Bash scripts
- local HTML/Markdown dashboards
- free, legal, stable public data feeds (with rate-limit awareness)
- self-hosted optional webhooks (Slack incoming webhook free tier, Discord free)
  — only if explicitly OPTIONAL, never a hard dependency

---

## No-profit-guarantee rule

Reviewers MUST NOT:

- claim the system "will" or "should" generate profit
- claim a high confidence score is a profit guarantee
- claim any backtest result implies forward returns
- recommend live trading
- recommend increased risk limits to "capture more upside"
- recommend disabling risk gates for any reason

Reviewers MAY assess:

- whether evidence of edge exists in the data
- whether edge persists out-of-sample (walk-forward)
- whether confidence score is logically constructed
- whether the system can defensively refuse to trade
- whether the system is fit for local replay
- whether the system is fit for paper trading
- whether the system should be blocked from live trading

---

## Runtime safety rule — agents are NOT the runtime brain

The audit board is a **review layer**, not an execution layer.

**Agents MAY:**
- analyze code, configs, docs, tests, logs, audit JSONL
- emit findings classified by priority and blocking status
- recommend fixes
- BLOCK release / paper trading / live readiness
- generate session-readiness reports

**Agents MUST NOT:**
- be invoked in the trading runtime path (signal → confidence → risk → audit)
- modify risk parameters, kill-switch, safe-mode, or strategy logic during a session
- replace the deterministic Risk Engine
- replace the deterministic Confidence Score
- be used to "approve" individual trades during a live session

The trading runtime stays deterministic. Agents review it AROUND the
runtime, not INSIDE it.

---

## Priority taxonomy

Every finding is classified with one priority:

| Priority | Meaning                                                    |
|---|---|
| **P0**   | Critical — blocks safe use. Must be fixed before paper trading |
| **P1**   | Very important. Should be fixed within current sprint        |
| **P2**   | Important. Fix in next iteration                              |
| **P3**   | Quality improvement. Nice-to-have                             |

---

## Required finding format

Every finding emitted by any agent MUST conform to
`agents/schemas/finding.schema.json`. Required fields:

```yaml
id:                  string  # e.g. "ARCH-001"
agent:               string  # which agent produced this
title:               string  # one-line summary
severity:            P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
area:                string  # architecture / risk / data / confidence / ...
affected_files:      string[]  # repo-relative paths
evidence:            string  # what the agent observed (quotes / log lines / code refs)
risk:                string  # what could go wrong if not fixed
recommendation:      string  # concrete fix
required_tests:      string[]  # tests that must be added/pass
free_operation_impact:    "none" | "improves" | "degrades" | "VIOLATES"
confidence_score_impact:  "neutral" | "raises_ceiling" | "lowers_floor" | "invalidates"
safety_impact:            "neutral" | "improves" | "degrades" | "compromises"
blocking_status:     BLOCKS_LOCAL_REPLAY | BLOCKS_PAPER_TRADING | BLOCKS_LIVE_TRADING | NEEDS_REFACTOR | NEEDS_TESTS | INFO_ONLY
status:              open | fix_in_progress | fixed | verified | wontfix
```

---

## Blocking statuses — semantics

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BLOCKS_LOCAL_REPLAY` | Even local backtest/replay is unsafe (e.g. lookahead bias) |
| `BLOCKS_PAPER_TRADING` | Paper trading should not begin until fixed |
| `BLOCKS_LIVE_TRADING` | Default for almost everything — live is gated by ALL fixes |
| `NEEDS_REFACTOR` | Behavior may be safe but code quality blocks confidence |
| `NEEDS_TESTS` | Missing test coverage prevents trusting behavior |
| `INFO_ONLY` | Documentation / nice-to-have — does not block |

---

## Output format

Each agent produces a single `agents/reports/<agent>_<YYYYMMDD>.md`
report following `agents/schemas/agent_report.schema.json`.

The `12_final_arbiter` agent reads ALL produced reports and emits
`agents/reports/final_decision_<YYYYMMDD>.md` per
`agents/schemas/final_decision.schema.json`.

---

## What to read before any review

When reviewing this repository, always start by reading:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — full session history + iron rules + live state
2. `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — operational procedures + scenarios
3. `docs/STRATEGY.md` — strategy contracts
4. `docs/PRODUCT.md` — system architecture + tech stack
5. `config/aggressive_profile.json` — risk parameters
6. `learning-loop/state.json` — strategy enable/disable state
7. `learning-loop/runtime_state.json` — current runtime snapshot
8. `journal/autonomy/<recent-date>.jsonl` — recent audit events
9. Latest `reports/sessions/latest.md` if exists

If any of these are missing or inconsistent with code, flag it.

---

## Forbidden language

Reviewers MUST NOT use phrases like:

- "this will be profitable"
- "guaranteed edge"
- "system is safe for live"
- "high confidence means high profit"
- "we recommend going live"
- "increase position size"
- "disable the risk check to capture more"

These phrases are red flags. Findings containing them are invalid.

---

## v3.20 coverage (added 2026-06-04)

When reviewing, you must also check the v3.20 Evidence Production
& Counterfactual Learning layer:

- `shared/evidence_production.py` — 3 modes (SIGNAL_ONLY default,
  SHADOW_PAPER_SIM, BROKER_PAPER). Default never live. BROKER_PAPER
  hard-asserts paper URL. Shadow fills go to
  `learning-loop/shadow_ledger/<date>.jsonl` with `evidence_source=PAPER`
  and `execution_source=SHADOW_SIM`.
- `shared/signal_opportunity_ledger.py` — records every signal
  (accepted/rejected/observe-only) to
  `learning-loop/opportunity_ledger/<date>.jsonl`. 6 gate types
  (confidence/risk/universe/regime/spread_slippage/quality). Every
  accepted entry has audit_link.
- `shared/counterfactual_outcomes.py` — hypothetical outcomes for
  rejected signals. CRITICAL: carries `evidence_source="COUNTERFACTUAL"`
  and MUST NOT count toward paper trade `n`. Mixing counterfactual
  with paper evidence is a P0 finding.
- `shared/gate_calibration.py` — per-gate accept/reject quality.
  CRITICAL: risk gate rejections that hypothetically would have
  profited are labeled `safety_correct_rejection` not
  `trading_opportunity_miss`. Risk gate NEVER auto-weakens.
- `shared/evidence_lower_bounds.py` — Wilson lower CI on WR, bootstrap
  PF/expectancy lower bounds, drawdown upper bound. Statuses:
  EVIDENCE_TOO_WEAK / EVIDENCE_IMPROVING / EVIDENCE_ROBUST_CANDIDATE /
  EVIDENCE_DEGRADING / EVIDENCE_REJECT. EDGE_GATE flip requires
  EVIDENCE_ROBUST_CANDIDATE (n>=50, PF_LB>=1.3, expectancy_LB>0).
- `shared/strategy_robustness.py` — sandbox; never optimizes, never
  mutates runtime. Output: robustness_score + fragility_warnings +
  overfit_suspicion + dependency flags.
- `shared/strategy_variant_quarantine.py` — variants in
  `learning-loop/variant_quarantine/<id>.json`. Statuses:
  QUARANTINED / REPLAY_TESTING / SHADOW_OBSERVE / REJECTED /
  CANDIDATE_FOR_MANUAL_REVIEW. NO LIVE status. Variants cannot
  enter runtime trading path.
- `shared/experiment_scheduler.py` — deterministic; never places
  trades, never raises risk, never changes gates. Output to
  `learning-loop/experiment_plans/experiment_plan_<date>.json` +
  `docs/experiment_plan_LATEST.md`.
- `shared/exit_quality.py` — recommendations only; no runtime
  mutation. Per-strategy/symbol/regime/confidence-bucket MFE/MAE/
  giveback/stop-efficiency.
- `scripts/operator_decision_pack.py` — consolidates v3.19 + v3.20
  modules into one read-only artifact. Outputs
  `docs/operator_decision_pack_LATEST.{md,json}`.

### Final Arbiter v3.20 escalation triggers (P0)

The Final Arbiter MUST block escalation and set primary verdict
to NEEDS_FIXES with secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when any
of the following is true:

- opportunity ledger empty for >= 5 paper-experiment-update runs
- counterfactual entries mixed into paper trade ledger (any
  paper-trade entry whose evidence_source is not PAPER)
- a strategy variant status mutated to a value NOT in
  {QUARANTINED, REPLAY_TESTING, SHADOW_OBSERVE, REJECTED,
  CANDIDATE_FOR_MANUAL_REVIEW}
- evidence_lower_bounds for a strategy show
  probability_of_negative_expectancy > 0.5 while the strategy
  is still PAPER_ENABLED in state.json::strategies
- robustness sandbox reports overfit_suspicion=true for a
  strategy proposed for EDGE_APPROVED_FOR_EXPERIMENT
- EDGE_GATE_ENABLED=true observed in any config without
  n>=50 paper, PF_LB>=1.3, calibrated confidence, and >=2
  regimes observed
- exit_quality flags >30% of closed trades with
  profit_giveback_pct > 30% but no follow-up recommendation
  in experiment plan
- gate_calibration shows bad_acceptance_rate > 0.25 for the
  confidence gate without a follow-up calibration ticket

The arbiter NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only PAPER_TRADING_*
verdicts are permitted.

---

## v3.21 coverage (added 2026-06-04)

v3.21 adds the Evidence Throughput & Strategy Discovery
Acceleration layer. When reviewing, also check these v3.21 modules:

- `shared/evidence_throughput.py` — per day / strategy / symbol /
  regime aggregates of opportunity + shadow + paper + counterfactual
  counts; estimated days to n=50; statuses (NO_EVIDENCE_FLOW /
  TOO_SLOW_TO_REACH_N50 / HEALTHY_SHADOW_FLOW /
  HEALTHY_BROKER_PAPER_FLOW / NEEDS_MORE_SYMBOLS /
  NEEDS_MORE_SIGNAL_DENSITY / NEEDS_MORE_REGIME_COVERAGE).
  Read-only; never places trades.
- `shared/signal_density_audit.py` — labels every strategy as
  DEAD_STRATEGY / TOO_SPARSE / NOISY_STRATEGY / HEALTHY_DENSITY /
  HIGH_REJECTION_BUT_PROMISING / NEEDS_VARIANT_DISCOVERY /
  NEEDS_UNIVERSE_EXPANSION. Audit emit per assignment.
- `scripts/run_shadow_evidence_cycle.py` — daily runner with
  `--dry-run` and `--mode {signal_only,shadow,broker}`. NO live
  mode (parser rejects --mode live). Cron template at
  `scripts/workflow-templates/shadow-evidence-cycle.yml`. Invariants
  LIVE_MODE_NOT_SUPPORTED, RUNNER_NEVER_BYPASSES_GATES,
  RUNNER_NEVER_PLACES_BROKER_ORDERS.
- `shared/multi_horizon_outcomes.py` — outcomes at 5/15/30/60min +
  EOD + next session open horizons. evidence_source="MULTI_HORIZON"
  (segregated from PAPER). Missing data → UNKNOWN. NEVER count as
  paper trade `n`.
- `shared/observation_priority.py` — per strategy-symbol-regime
  priority_score in [0,1]; statuses PRIORITY_OBSERVE /
  NORMAL_OBSERVE / LOW_PRIORITY / DO_NOT_OBSERVE / NEEDS_DATA.
  Does NOT enable trading.
- `shared/strategy_discovery_sandbox.py` — generates variant
  proposals only into `strategy_variant_quarantine`. Invariants
  DISCOVERY_NEVER_ENABLES_RUNTIME, DISCOVERY_NEVER_PLACES_TRADES,
  DISCOVERY_NEVER_REMOVES_GATES.
- `shared/broker_paper_adapter.py` — hardened paper wrapper.
  Requires `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER=true` env. Hard-asserts paper URL.
  Default dry-run. MAX_ORDER_NOTIONAL_USD=100. Missing credentials
  → SHADOW_FALLBACK. Invariants ADAPTER_PAPER_ONLY,
  ADAPTER_REQUIRES_IDEMPOTENCY, ADAPTER_FAIL_CLOSED.
- `shared/fill_model_calibration.py` — compares shadow vs broker
  paper fills. < 20 paired observations → status
  INSUFFICIENT_BROKER_PAPER_DATA. Does NOT mutate model.
- `shared/evidence_budget.py` — deterministic caps (500 shadow
  observations/day, 20 variants/day, 30 symbols/strategy, 200
  counterfactuals/run, 600s workflow runtime). Invariant
  BUDGET_BYPASSES_SAFETY = True (safety reports always pass).
- `shared/operator_action_queue.py` — append-only queue in
  `learning-loop/operator_action_queue.jsonl`. Action types:
  REVIEW_STRATEGY / REVIEW_VARIANT / DISABLE_CANDIDATE /
  KEEP_OBSERVING / ADD_DATA_SOURCE_REVIEW / CHECK_BROKER_PAPER /
  REVIEW_GATE_CALIBRATION / REVIEW_FILL_MODEL / REVIEW_EDGE_GATE /
  NO_ACTION. Every entry has `can_auto_apply=False` (asserted).
  Invariants QUEUE_NEVER_AUTO_APPLIES,
  QUEUE_RISKY_ACTIONS_NON_AUTO_APPLY. Deterministic phrasing only
  ("non-auto-apply by design", "review-gated", "governed by").

### Final Arbiter v3.21 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to v3.20 triggers, the Final Arbiter MUST block
escalation and set primary verdict to NEEDS_FIXES with secondary
NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- `scripts/run_shadow_evidence_cycle.py` can be invoked with
  `--mode live` (live mode must be rejected at parser level)
- `shared/broker_paper_adapter.py` does not hard-assert paper URL
  before any HTTP request
- `shared/strategy_discovery_sandbox.py` writes a variant directly
  into `learning-loop/state.json::strategies` (must go through
  `strategy_variant_quarantine.register_variant`)
- `shared/evidence_throughput.py` reports zero flow for 5+
  consecutive days while runner workflow has been deployed
- `shared/signal_density_audit.py` flags >= 50% of strategies as
  DEAD_STRATEGY but no follow-up action exists in operator queue
- `shared/fill_model_calibration.py` reports model mutated despite
  INSUFFICIENT_BROKER_PAPER_DATA status
- `shared/operator_action_queue.py` contains any entry where
  `can_auto_apply=True` (queue invariant violation)
- `shared/evidence_budget.py` reports BUDGET_BYPASSES_SAFETY=False
  or any safety report was suppressed by budget
- `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED=true` observed without n>=50 broker paper or
  shadow paper evidence (SHADOW + COUNTERFACTUAL + MULTI_HORIZON do
  not satisfy this; only `evidence_source="PAPER"` records count)

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts.

---

## v3.23 coverage (added 2026-06-08)

v3.23 repairs broker-state reconciliation + trade reconstruction
after the 2026-06-08 incident where state.json::cumulative.total_trades
was 0 despite 7 confirmed safe_close events for the 2026-06-04
equity positions and dashboard showed ETH/AVAX/SOL/LTC open while
local state was widely stale.

When reviewing, also check:

- `shared/position_reconciliation_status.py` — formal 16-status enum
  classifier. READ-ONLY. Distinguishes VERIFIED_OPEN vs STALE_LOCAL
  vs DASHBOARD_VERIFIED vs BROKER_SIDE_CLOSED.
- `shared/trade_reconstruction.py` — FIFO lot matcher with explicit
  TRADE_CLOSED_WITH_PNL / TRADE_CLOSED_PRICE_MISSING /
  TRADE_BROKER_SIDE_CLOSE_INFERRED / TRADE_PARTIAL_CLOSE /
  TRADE_UNMATCHED_OPEN / TRADE_UNMATCHED_CLOSE statuses.
  CRITICAL: NEVER_INVENTS_PRICES; missing fill prices yield
  TRADE_CLOSED_PRICE_MISSING, not fake P&L.
- `shared/crypto_precision.py` — classifies Alpaca 403 responses
  into CLOSE_BLOCKED_BY_PRECISION_ROUNDING etc. `round_qty_down()`
  NEVER rounds up. Repeated-failure deduper caps retries at 3.
- `shared/drawdown_attribution.py` — disambiguates drawdown source
  (REALIZED / UNREALIZED / BASELINE_STALE / UNKNOWN). NEVER resets
  baseline automatically. NEVER lowers drawdown threshold.
- `shared/silent_strategy_classification.py` — funnel-based status
  (NO_SIGNALS / SIGNALS_BUT_NO_ORDERS / ORDERS_BUT_NO_FILLS /
  FILLS_BUT_NO_RECONSTRUCTED_TRADES / RECONSTRUCTION_FAILED /
  ACTIVE_BUT_ANALYZER_STALE / TRULY_SILENT). CRITICAL:
  RECONSTRUCTION_FAILURE_BLOCKS_AUTO_DISABLE — a strategy with
  fills + closes but reconstruction = 0 must NOT be auto-disabled.
- `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/operator_dashboard_snapshot.json`
  is sanitized manual input from the operator; reviewers must
  treat it as `source=OPERATOR_DASHBOARD_MANUAL` and NOT as full
  Alpaca API truth.

### Final Arbiter v3.23 escalation triggers (P0)

The Final Arbiter MUST block escalation and set primary verdict to
NEEDS_FIXES with secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- analyzer still reports `cumulative_trades = 0` despite safe_close
  events present in audit JSONL
- local state conflicts with dashboard and no v3.23 reconciliation
  status is emitted
- AMD-style positions (no safe_close + dashboard NOT_open) are
  treated as VERIFIED_OPEN
- ETHUSD close loop emits 403 precision errors without classification
  via `crypto_precision.classify_precision_error`
- a strategy is marked auto-disabled despite `block_auto_disable=True`
  from `silent_strategy_classification`
- drawdown_guard threshold is lowered automatically
- starting_equity baseline is reset automatically (operator-only
  action)
- trade reconstruction returns fake P&L when fill prices are missing
  (must be `TRADE_CLOSED_PRICE_MISSING`, not invented number)

---

## v3.23.2 coverage (added 2026-06-08)

v3.23.2 extends v3.23.1 by reconstructing the 7 remaining
2026-06-04 equity trades (CRWD / NOW / QQQ / SPY / GLD / PANW / ORCL)
from operator-provided Order History, AND investigates the
safe-close audit gap exposed by v3.23.1's AMD reconciliation
(market sell_to_close via Alpaca `access_key` with NO matching
`safe_close` event in local audit JSONL).

When reviewing, also check:

- `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/manual_order_history_remaining_2026-06-04.json`
  — placeholder structure for 7 symbols. Every entry uses
  `data_quality = REQUIRES_OPERATOR_EXTRACTION` and every fill
  price is `null` until the operator transcribes the Order History
  rows. NEVER invents prices. The reconstruction helper
  `shared/trade_reconstruction.py::trade_from_manual_order_history`
  returns `TRADE_CLOSED_PRICE_MISSING` on missing fields — fake
  P&L is forbidden.
- `docs/OPERATOR_ORDER_HISTORY_EXTRACTION_CHECKLIST.md` — what the
  operator must transcribe per symbol. Does NOT ask for credentials,
  screenshots, or raw API dumps. Sanitized table values only.
- `shared/drawdown_attribution.py` extended with four new statuses:
  `DRAWDOWN_ATTRIBUTION_COMPLETE`, `DRAWDOWN_ATTRIBUTION_PARTIAL`,
  `DRAWDOWN_ATTRIBUTION_REQUIRES_ORDER_HISTORY`,
  `DRAWDOWN_ATTRIBUTION_CONFLICT`. The helper
  `compute_partial_attribution()` returns `PARTIAL` while AMD is
  known and 7 symbols are unknown, `CONFLICT` when known realized
  P/L diverges from the observed drawdown by >30% or >$100. Baseline
  is NEVER reset automatically.
- `shared/audit_bypass_detector.py` — static classifier for every
  Python file that could submit sell/close orders. Six
  classifications: `SAFE_CLOSE_WRAPPED`, `AUDIT_EQUIVALENT_WRAPPED`,
  `READ_ONLY`, `ORDER_SUBMITTER_BYPASS`, `LEGACY_DANGEROUS`,
  `UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_REVIEW`. Three test-asserted invariants:
  `NO_DIRECT_MARKET_SELL_WITHOUT_AUDIT`,
  `NO_SELL_TO_CLOSE_WITHOUT_SAFE_CLOSE_OR_EQUIVALENT_AUDIT`,
  `ACCESS_KEY_ORDER_PATH_MUST_EMIT_AUDIT`. Allow-list contains the
  three legitimate sell submitters: `shared/alpaca_orders.py`,
  `options-monitor/monitor.py`, `shared/broker_paper_adapter.py`.
  v3.23.2 scan flags `scripts/emergency_close_20260602.py` and
  `scripts/emergency_close_20260603.py` as `LEGACY_DANGEROUS`.
- `shared/amd_close_source_search.py` — static, READ-ONLY search for
  evidence of the AMD close source in local logs. Self-reference
  filter excludes `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/`, `docs/`,
  and the search module itself (those mention the order_id but are
  not evidence). Two classifications: `AMD_CLOSE_SOURCE_IDENTIFIED`,
  `AMD_CLOSE_SOURCE_NOT_FOUND_LOCAL_LOGS_REQUIRE_GH_ACTIONS_OR_API_HISTORY`.
  v3.23.2 result is the latter — no local STRONG matches; followup
  requires GitHub Actions run logs OR Alpaca order-history API.
- `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/audit_bypass_investigation_latest.json`
  — committed real-repo scan output. `risk_level=HIGH`,
  `invariant_satisfied=False`, flagged 2 legacy scripts.
- `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/amd_close_source_search_latest.json`
  — committed search output. `classification` is the unknown enum,
  `confirmed_path = null`.

### Final Arbiter v3.23.2 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to all v3.23 triggers, the Final Arbiter MUST block
escalation and set primary verdict to NEEDS_FIXES with secondary
NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- a `MARKET_SELL_CLOSE_VIA_ACCESS_KEY_WITHOUT_SAFE_CLOSE_AUDIT`
  finding remains unresolved (audit gap not closed)
- placeholder JSON entries are silently mutated to `COMPLETE` with
  invented fill prices (data_quality enum is not honored)
- a file outside `ALLOW_LIST` is classified `ORDER_SUBMITTER_BYPASS`
  or `LEGACY_DANGEROUS` and is left active in cron/workflow paths
- `compute_partial_attribution` is misused to fabricate
  `DRAWDOWN_ATTRIBUTION_COMPLETE` when ≥1 symbol is unknown
- the AMD close source is set to a `STRONG` confirmed path
  without an actual STRONG match in the real-repo scan
- baseline `state.json::cumulative.starting_equity` is reset
  silently to absorb the unattributed -$5,304 residual
- placeholder data flips `data_quality` to a non-placeholder enum
  without operator-supplied values
- legacy `emergency_close_*` scripts are re-introduced without
  being rewritten to call `safe_close()` or write an audit event

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts.

---

## v3.23.3 coverage (added 2026-06-08)

v3.23.3 quarantines the 2 legacy direct-order scripts surfaced by
v3.23.2's static scan and adds a forensic GitHub Actions
investigation report for the AMD 2026-06-05 close audit gap.

When reviewing, also check:

- `scripts/quarantined_legacy_order_scripts/` — the dedicated
  quarantine directory. Holds `emergency_close_20260602.py.disabled`
  and `emergency_close_20260603.py.disabled` plus a README that
  documents the rules (DO NOT RUN, DO NOT RESTORE, only call
  `safe_close()`). The `.py.disabled` extension makes the files inert
  to Python's runner and import system.
- `shared/audit_bypass_detector.py` — extended with a new
  classification `QUARANTINED_LEGACY_DANGEROUS` (now in
  `ALL_CLASSIFICATIONS`), a new module-level boolean invariant
  `NO_ACTIVE_LEGACY_DANGEROUS_ORDER_SCRIPT = True`, a
  `QUARANTINE_DIR_MARKER` constant, and an extended
  `detect_bypasses()` that scans `.py.disabled` files, tracks them
  under a new `quarantined_files` key, and excludes them from
  `flagged_files`. Real-repo scan now returns
  `invariant_satisfied = True`, `flagged_files = []`,
  `quarantined_files = [2 paths]`.
- `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/audit_bypass_investigation_latest.json`
  refreshed: `version=v3.23.3`, `risk_level` downgraded
  `HIGH → MEDIUM`, `flagged_count=0`, `quarantined_count=2`,
  invariant satisfied. Quarantine metadata recorded.
- `docs/AMD_CLOSE_SOURCE_INVESTIGATION.md` +
  `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/amd_close_source_gh_actions_investigation_latest.json`
  — read-only GitHub Actions forensic report. Investigated 200
  workflow runs in 2026-06-05T20-23Z window via `gh CLI`.
  **Decisive finding:** at 2026-06-05T21:35:45Z (the exact AMD
  order submission moment) ZERO workflows were active. Previous
  cron wave ended 21:31:29Z; next wave started 21:35:52Z — leaving
  a 4m16s gap. The order arrived 7 seconds before any next-wave
  workflow began. Classification: `AMD_CLOSE_SOURCE_NOT_FOUND_IN_GITHUB_ACTIONS`.
  Confirmed source still **None** — operator must pull the
  Alpaca order's `client_order_id` via the API.

### Final Arbiter v3.23.3 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to all v3.23 + v3.23.2 triggers, the Final Arbiter MUST
block escalation and set primary verdict to NEEDS_FIXES with
secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- any `scripts/*.py` (NOT under
  `scripts/quarantined_legacy_order_scripts/`) contains
  `requests.post(/v2/orders)` AND a sell-side literal AND is NOT in
  `audit_bypass_detector.ALLOW_LIST`
- either quarantined `.py.disabled` file is reverted back to `.py`,
  moved out of `scripts/quarantined_legacy_order_scripts/`, or
  imported from any active code path
- `scripts/quarantined_legacy_order_scripts/` or either
  `.py.disabled` file is added to the audit-bypass `ALLOW_LIST`
  (silently legitimising the bypass)
- the AMD close source is set to a confirmed value without an
  Alpaca order-history `client_order_id` retrieval (no GitHub
  Actions evidence is now decisive against any of the GH-Actions
  candidate classifications)
- `NO_ACTIVE_LEGACY_DANGEROUS_ORDER_SCRIPT` flips to False in a
  later sprint without an accompanying remediation plan
- `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/audit_bypass_investigation_latest.json`
  shows `flagged_count > 0` after a future scan run
- the README in `scripts/quarantined_legacy_order_scripts/` is
  deleted or rewritten to remove the rules

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts.

## v3.25.0 coverage (added 2026-06-09)

v3.25 ships the crypto position-sizing / laddering / cooldown / exit
guards plus a deterministic unlock-readiness gate, in response to the
v3.24 reattribution that placed the bulk of the -$5,741 drawdown on
the SOLUSD + LTCUSD realized close cycle on 2026-06-06.

When reviewing, also check:

- `docs/CRYPTO_SOL_LTC_POSITION_SIZING_INCIDENT.md` +
  `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/crypto_sol_ltc_sizing_incident_latest.json`
  — root-cause investigation. Confirmed: laddering uncapped, per-symbol
  dollar cap missing, pending-order pre-check missing. Some details
  marked `CRYPTO_ROOT_CAUSE_REQUIRES_MORE_LOGS`.
- `shared/crypto_exposure_policy.py` — hard per-symbol +
  aggregate caps, laddering limit, cooldown, recent-loss cooldown,
  pending-order pre-check, drawdown-guard hard block. Defaults
  conservative (10% aggregate / 3% per symbol / 2 meaningful
  symbols / 1 buy per symbol per day / 240 min cooldown / 72 h
  recent-loss cooldown / $500 loss threshold). Wired into
  `place_crypto_order` via `_crypto_exposure_policy_gate`,
  fail-CLOSED for BUY.
- `shared/crypto_exit_policy.py` — closed enum of allowed exit
  reasons + narrower `MARKET_EXIT_ALLOWED_REASONS`. Dust exits
  require operator approval. Precision rounding NEVER rounds up.
  Repeated close attempts within 10 min are deduped.
- `shared/trading_unlock_readiness.py` — verdict ladder
  `TRADING_UNLOCK_BLOCKED` → `SIGNAL_SHADOW_UNLOCK_READY` →
  `BROKER_PAPER_CANARY_NOT_READY` → `BROKER_PAPER_CANARY_READY` →
  `LIVE_TRADING_NOT_SUPPORTED`. Maximum verdict in v3.25 is
  `SIGNAL_SHADOW_UNLOCK_READY`. Live trading is permanently marked
  unsupported.
- `docs/TRADING_UNLOCK_READINESS.md` — operator-facing guide.
- New tests pin: SOL/LTC 60% combined exposure blocked; repeated
  5-min buys blocked; per-symbol 3% cap; aggregate 10% cap; market
  exit requires risk reason; dust exit requires operator approval;
  precision never rounds up; broker paper requires evidence.

### Final Arbiter v3.25.0 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to all v3.23.x + v3.24 triggers, the Final Arbiter MUST
block escalation and set primary verdict to NEEDS_FIXES with
secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- crypto **aggregate exposure cap is missing** or weakened past the
  v3.25 default (10% gross)
- crypto **per-symbol cap is missing** or weakened past the v3.25
  default (3% per symbol)
- repeated crypto buys can happen **every 5 minutes** (cooldown
  weakened below the v3.25 default 240 min)
- an **existing meaningful position does not block** a new buy of
  the same symbol
- a **pending order does not block** a duplicate buy of the same
  symbol
- the **drawdown guard does not block** new crypto buys when active
- a **recent realized crypto loss does not trigger cooldown** under
  default thresholds
- a **market exit lacks a structured reason** from `ALLOWED_EXIT_REASONS`
- **dust is auto-closed** without operator decision
- `evaluate_unlock_readiness` returns `BROKER_PAPER_CANARY_READY`
  **without** the four evidence thresholds met AND explicit operator
  approval
- `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED` is flipped to True
- `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER` is enabled
- baseline `state.json::cumulative.starting_equity` is reset silently
- live trading is enabled in any form

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts.

## v3.26.0 coverage (added 2026-06-09)

v3.26 ships the signal/shadow evidence-collection scaffolding. The
unlock verdict ladder is unchanged; v3.26 only adds the operator
playbook + preflight + counters + dry-run collector + JSON Schema
that the v3.25 `trading_unlock_readiness` gate consumes.

When reviewing, also check:

- `shared/signal_shadow_preflight.py` — single-call preflight that
  emits 14 named confirmation tokens or a blocker list. Returns
  `SIGNAL_SHADOW_PREFLIGHT_PASS` only when every broker-execution
  flag is off, the audit-bypass invariant is True, the quarantined
  scripts remain `.py.disabled`, and the unlock verdict is
  `SIGNAL_SHADOW_UNLOCK_READY` or higher.
- `shared/shadow_evidence_counters.py` — monotonic counter store
  under `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/evidence_counters_latest.json`.
  `save_counters()` refuses to write if any of
  `broker_order_submitted_ever`, `live_trading_enabled`,
  `broker_paper_enabled` is True.
- `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/schema.json` — shadow decision JSON
  Schema. `broker_order_submitted` and `broker_execution_enabled`
  are pinned to `enum: [false]`; any future caller attempting to
  flip them must fail JSON validation.
- `scripts/run_signal_shadow_evidence_collection.py` — dry-run
  collector. Refuses to proceed if `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER`,
  `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED`, `BROKER_EXECUTION_ENABLED`, `LIVE_TRADING`,
  `LIVE_ENABLED`, `GO_LIVE`, or `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` is truthy.
  Does NOT import `shared/alpaca_orders.py`.
- `docs/SIGNAL_SHADOW_EVIDENCE_COLLECTION_RUNBOOK.md` +
  `docs/SHADOW_EVIDENCE_PROGRESS.md` — operator-facing playbook +
  current progress.

### Final Arbiter v3.26.0 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to all v3.23.x / v3.24 / v3.25 triggers, the Final
Arbiter MUST block escalation and set primary verdict to
NEEDS_FIXES with secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- the `shared/signal_shadow_preflight.py::run_preflight()` verdict
  is `SIGNAL_SHADOW_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED` and a downstream operation
  ignores it
- `scripts/run_signal_shadow_evidence_collection.py` is modified to
  import a function from `shared/alpaca_orders.py` (or any other
  module that submits orders)
- the v3.26 collector ever returns `SHADOW_COLLECTION_PROCEEDING`
  while `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER` / `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED` /
  `BROKER_EXECUTION_ENABLED` / `LIVE_TRADING` are truthy
- any shadow record persisted under
  `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/records_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` carries
  `broker_order_submitted=true` or `broker_execution_enabled=true`
- the `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/schema.json` is weakened to
  allow `broker_order_submitted=true` or
  `broker_execution_enabled=true`
- the counter file is mutated to inflate
  `normal_non_halt_opportunities_count` or
  `completed_shadow_outcomes_count` without matching evidence
  records
- the v3.25 `trading_unlock_readiness` thresholds (50 normal / 20
  outcomes / 0 audit bypass / 0 exposure breach) are weakened
- `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED` is flipped to True
- `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER` is enabled
- baseline `state.json::cumulative.starting_equity` is reset
- live trading is enabled in any form

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts.

## v3.27.0 coverage (added 2026-06-09)

v3.27 automates the v3.26 signal/shadow evidence pipeline. The
verdict ladder is unchanged; v3.27 adds the missing real-market
data path so the v3.25 `trading_unlock_readiness` gate can
eventually advance toward `BROKER_PAPER_CANARY_READY` purely from
automated evidence — no manual collector runs.

When reviewing, also check:

- `shared/market_data_provider.py` — read-only Alpaca-data fetcher
  (`data.alpaca.markets`). Never imports `shared/alpaca_orders.py`.
  Returns `MarketSnapshot` with the 4-value `data_quality` enum
  (`REAL_MARKET_DATA` / `NO_MARKET_DATA` / `STALE_MARKET_DATA` /
  `PROVIDER_ERROR`). Fail-soft on missing creds / network errors —
  never fabricates price.
- `shared/shadow_opportunity_generator.py` — wraps the pure
  `backtest/strategies.py::*_signal_at` functions. Emits a record
  ONLY when the snapshot is `REAL_MARKET_DATA` AND daily bars are
  present. Applies the v3.25 crypto exposure policy + drawdown
  guard as `would_block` reasons (never blocks the broker — it
  just records that an order WOULD be blocked).
- `shared/shadow_outcome_resolver.py` + `scripts/resolve_shadow_outcomes.py`
  — sidecar outcome writer. Records are append-only to
  `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/outcomes_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. Marks
  every outcome `SHADOW_OUTCOME` with
  `is_broker_realized_pnl=false`. Skips scaffold + halt-path
  records by `evidence_quality` filter.
- `scripts/update_shadow_evidence_progress.py` — rewrites the
  auto-progress section of `docs/SHADOW_EVIDENCE_PROGRESS.md`
  between markers `<!-- v3.27 auto-progress-start -->` and
  `<!-- v3.27 auto-progress-end -->` from live counters.
- `.github/workflows/signal-shadow-evidence.yml` — automation
  driver. Cron `35 13-19 * * 1-5`. Hard-pins all 7 broker-execution
  env flags `false` at workflow `env` level. Path allow-list at
  commit time enforces only
  `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/**`, `docs/SHADOW_EVIDENCE_PROGRESS.md`,
  `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/latest.json`.
- `scripts/audit_workflows.py::CONTENTS_WRITE_ALLOWLIST` — extended
  to include `signal-shadow-evidence.yml`.
- `shared/trading_unlock_readiness.py` — `UnlockReadinessInputs`
  gained `real_market_opportunities_count`; `_broker_paper_blockers`
  now reads it; `evaluate_from_current_repo_state` loads live
  counters from disk.

### v3.27 status tokens (added)

- `AUTOMATED_SHADOW_EVIDENCE_PIPELINE_READY`
- `REAL_MARKET_DATA_COLLECTION_AUTOMATED`
- `OUTCOME_RESOLUTION_AUTOMATED`

### Final Arbiter v3.27.0 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to all v3.23.x / v3.24 / v3.25 / v3.26 triggers, the
Final Arbiter MUST block escalation and set primary verdict to
NEEDS_FIXES with secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- the v3.27 collector or resolver acquires an import of
  `shared/alpaca_orders.py`
- any record in `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/records_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
  carries `broker_order_submitted=true` or `broker_execution_enabled=true`
- the `signal-shadow-evidence.yml` workflow drops an env hard-pin
  for ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER / EDGE_GATE_ENABLED / BROKER_EXECUTION_ENABLED
  / LIVE_TRADING / LIVE_ENABLED / GO_LIVE / LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED
- the workflow path allow-list is widened beyond
  `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/**`, `docs/SHADOW_EVIDENCE_PROGRESS.md`,
  and `learning-loop/position_reconciliation/latest.json`
- `signal-shadow-evidence.yml` is removed from
  `scripts/audit_workflows.py::CONTENTS_WRITE_ALLOWLIST`
- `real_market_opportunities_count` is incremented from a code path
  that does NOT also write a `REAL_MARKET_DATA` record to the day's
  JSONL
- a SHADOW outcome record is misrepresented as `is_broker_realized_pnl=true`
- the v3.25 thresholds (50 real opportunities / 20 outcomes / 0
  audit-bypass / 0 exposure breach) are weakened
- `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED` is flipped True
- `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER` is enabled
- baseline `state.json::cumulative.starting_equity` is silently reset
- live trading is enabled in any form

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts.

## v3.27.1 coverage (added 2026-06-09)

v3.27.1 layers a deterministic **automated-pipeline healthcheck** on
top of the v3.27.0 cron driver, so an operator (or the audit board)
can answer a single question — *"is the automated shadow workflow
making progress toward the v3.25 50/20 thresholds, or is it stuck?"*
— from one health artifact.

When reviewing, also check:

- `shared/market_data_provider.py` — extended with **9 granular
  diagnostic tokens** (`ALL_STATUS_TOKENS` frozenset) that replace
  the v3.27.0 `HALT_PATH_ONLY` catch-all:
  `MARKET_DATA_CREDENTIALS_MISSING`, `MARKET_DATA_AUTH_FAILED`,
  `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER_ERROR`, `MARKET_DATA_EMPTY_RESPONSE`,
  `MARKET_CLOSED_OR_NO_BARS`, `MARKET_DATA_STALE`,
  `INSUFFICIENT_BARS_FOR_SIGNAL`,
  `REAL_MARKET_DATA_AVAILABLE_BUT_NO_SIGNAL`,
  `REAL_MARKET_SIGNAL_RECORDS_EMITTED`. Every quote return path
  attaches one token to the `MarketSnapshot.status_token` field; the
  9 modes are mutually exclusive. New helper
  `fetch_daily_bars_diagnostic(symbol)` returns
  `(bars, status_token)` and distinguishes the four failure modes
  the v3.27.0 `fetch_daily_bars` silently coalesced to `None`.
- `scripts/run_signal_shadow_evidence_collection.py` — extended with
  `per_symbol_diagnostics` aggregation. Every symbol the collector
  considers appears in the summary with `{symbol, status_token,
  reason}` so the audit board can see *which* symbols hit each
  failure mode in the most recent cron tick.
- `scripts/evaluate_automated_shadow_progress.py` — **NEW**
  pure-function verdict evaluator. Reads
  `evidence_counters_latest.json` + the most recent
  `workflow_health_latest.json` + caller-passed workflow-run /
  collector / resolver / secrets statuses; emits one of 6 verdicts:
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_HEALTHY_NO_REAL_DATA_YET`,
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_HEALTHY_COLLECTING_REAL_MARKET_DATA`,
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_BLOCKED_NO_SECRETS`,
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_BLOCKED_PROVIDER_ERROR`,
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_BLOCKED_WORKFLOW_FAILURE`,
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_BLOCKED_SCHEMA_OR_COUNTER_ERROR`. Standing
  markers `BROKER_PAPER_CANARY_STILL_BLOCKED` and
  `LIVE_TRADING_UNSUPPORTED` are returned with every verdict —
  there is NO verdict that unblocks broker paper or live trading.
  The script refuses (exit 1) if any of
  `ALLOW_BROKER_PAPER` / `EDGE_GATE_ENABLED` /
  `BROKER_EXECUTION_ENABLED` / `LIVE_TRADING` / `LIVE_ENABLED` /
  `GO_LIVE` / `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` is truthy. NEVER imports the
  broker-orders module.
- `learning-loop/shadow_evidence/workflow_health_latest.json` —
  **NEW** auto-refreshed health artifact. Contains: verdict,
  rationale lines, standing markers, last workflow run id /
  conclusion, last collector / resolver statuses, secrets status,
  diagnostic_token_counts, counters_snapshot, safety block.
- `docs/AUTOMATED_SHADOW_WORKFLOW_HEALTH.md` — **NEW** human-view
  mirror of the JSON. Generated by the evaluator. Path is in the
  `signal-shadow-evidence.yml` allow-list.
- `.github/workflows/signal-shadow-evidence.yml` — extended with an
  `Evaluate automated pipeline health` step (calls the new
  evaluator with `--workflow-run-id`, `--workflow-run-conclusion`,
  `--collector-status`, `--resolver-status`,
  `--secrets-status SECRETS_AVAILABLE`). Commit allow-list
  extended to include
  `docs/AUTOMATED_SHADOW_WORKFLOW_HEALTH.md`. Hard-pinned
  broker-execution env flags are unchanged.

### v3.27.1 status tokens (added)

- 6 verdicts of the new evaluator (see list above).
- 9 diagnostic status tokens in `ALL_STATUS_TOKENS`.

### Final Arbiter v3.27.1 escalation triggers (P0)

In addition to all v3.23.x / v3.24 / v3.25 / v3.26 / v3.27.0
triggers, the Final Arbiter MUST block escalation and set primary
verdict to NEEDS_FIXES with secondary NOT_SAFE_FOR_LIVE_TRADING when:

- the v3.27.1 evaluator drops the
  `BROKER_PAPER_CANARY_STILL_BLOCKED` or `LIVE_TRADING_UNSUPPORTED`
  standing markers from its emitted `workflow_health_latest.json`
- `evaluate_automated_shadow_progress.py` returns a verdict
  outside its enum, or returns ANY verdict while a
  broker-execution env flag is truthy (the script must refuse first)
- `evaluate_automated_shadow_progress.py` acquires an import of
  the broker-orders module
- `workflow_health_latest.json` records a verdict of
  `AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_HEALTHY_COLLECTING_REAL_MARKET_DATA` while
  `real_market_opportunities_count == 0` (verdict / counter
  mismatch)
- the collector emits a `per_symbol_diagnostics` entry whose
  `status_token` is not in `ALL_STATUS_TOKENS` (introduction of an
  unaudited diagnostic mode)
- `MARKET_DATA_AUTH_FAILED` count is >0 for more than 2
  consecutive successful workflow runs without an operator-visible
  alert (silent auth outage — credentials may have been rotated
  away)
- the `signal-shadow-evidence.yml` workflow drops the
  `Evaluate automated pipeline health` step
- the v3.27.1 evaluator's refusal list shrinks (any of the 7 env
  flags removed from the truthy-refusal check)

The arbiter still NEVER recommends LIVE_TRADING — only
PAPER_TRADING_* verdicts. The v3.27.1 verdict
`AUTOMATED_PIPELINE_HEALTHY_COLLECTING_REAL_MARKET_DATA` does NOT
unblock the canary — the canary remains gated on the v3.25
50 real opportunities / 20 outcomes / explicit operator approval.
